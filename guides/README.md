## Sharding

Sharding is the process of splitting your main discord process into multiple shards to help with the load when your bot is in 2,500+ guilds. Discord.js has recommended to start making updates for sharding at around 2,000 guilds. [Discord.js Sharding Guide]([Getting started | Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/sharding/#when-to-shard))

That being said if you are at that point where sharding is needed you can take a look at this [guide](https://github.com/OwenCalvin/discord.ts/blob/master/guides/sharding.md).
